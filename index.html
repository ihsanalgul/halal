        <h2 class="story-title">1. The Mountain Expedition</h2>
        <span class="themes">Themes: Geography, Nature, Appearance, 'Used to'</span>
        <p>
            Last summer, five friends decided <strong>to head to</strong> the mountains in the <strong>north</strong>. The group leader, John, was a <strong>stocky</strong> man in his <strong>forties</strong> with a thick <strong>beard</strong>. He was very <strong>athletic</strong> and experienced. Sarah, who was <strong>petite</strong> and usually looked very <strong>glamorous</strong> in the city, looked a bit <strong>scruffy</strong> in her hiking gear, but she was ready.
        </p>
        <p>
            They set up their camp in a <strong>valley</strong> near a cold mountain <strong>lake</strong>. The <strong>surroundings</strong> were stunning. John pointed to a high peak. "That <strong>summit</strong> is our goal," he said. "We have to <strong>climb</strong> that steep <strong>slope</strong>."
        </p>
        <p>
            Tom, another friend, looked nervous. "I <strong>used to</strong> be terrified of heights," he admitted. "But I want to try."
        </p>
        <p>
            They started walking along a rocky <strong>trail</strong>. They passed a dark <strong>cave</strong> and drank water from a natural <strong>spring</strong>. It was a difficult climb, far from any <strong>populated</strong> <strong>area</strong>. To <strong>survive</strong> in such wilderness, you need to trust your team. When they finally reached the top, the view of the <strong>plain</strong> below and the distant <strong>ocean</strong> <strong>coast</strong> to the <strong>west</strong> was incredible.

        <h2 class="story-title">2. Dinner at "The Spicy Pepper"</h2>
        <span class="themes">Themes: Food, Tastes, Restaurant, Present Continuous vs Simple</span>
        <p>
            Martha and Peter wanted to try a new restaurant. They made a <strong>reservation</strong> at a place famous for its <strong>spicy</strong> food.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do we <strong>have a table</strong>?" Peter asked the waiter.
            <br>"Yes, right this way," the waiter said, placing a cloth <strong>napkin</strong> on their laps. "Tonight, the chef's appetizer is <strong>on the house</strong>. It's a real <strong>treat</strong>."
        </p>
        <p>
            He brought a plate of <strong>crunchy</strong> fried vegetables. "Martha is <strong>tasting</strong> the appetizer right now," Peter thought. "She looks happy."
            <br>"Mmm, this <strong>tastes</strong> delicious," Martha said. "I love the <strong>flavor</strong> of the fresh <strong>ingredients</strong>."
        </p>
        <p>
            For the main course, Martha, who is a <strong>vegetarian</strong>, ordered a <strong>savory</strong> stew packed with <strong>cabbage</strong>, <strong>bell peppers</strong>, and beans. Peter, who was very hungry, was ready <strong>to devour</strong> the <strong>daily special</strong>: a large steak.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chef is known <strong>to whip up</strong> amazing sauces. "Be careful, the sauce is hot!" the waiter warned. It was a fantastic meal. They were so <strong>full up</strong> that they couldn't eat dessert, not even a small <strong>pastry</strong>. They paid the bill and left a generous <strong>tip</strong>.

        <p>
            The country's <strong>capital</strong> city is located far in the <strong>south</strong>, but the most interesting city is "Rivertown" on the northern <strong>border</strong>. It is a heavily <strong>populated</strong> city built near a massive <strong>rock</strong> formation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The city's main attraction is a dormant volcano that is not expected <strong>to erupt</strong> again. Many people travel there just to see the volcano's massive crater. The <strong>surroundings</strong> are very dry, almost like a <strong>desert</strong>, because it rarely rains.
        </p>
        <p>
            My cousin's fiancée lives there. I don't know her well; she is just an <strong>acquaintance</strong> really, but she seems nice. She is a <strong>middle-aged</strong> woman who always looks very <strong>tanned</strong> because of the sunny climate. She says the best thing about the city is the <strong>people's</strong> spirit and the amazing <strong>sunsets'</strong> colors. It's important to her to live in a place with such unique geography.
